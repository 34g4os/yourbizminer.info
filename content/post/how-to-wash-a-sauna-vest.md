Because the purpose of a sauna suit is to encourage you to produce more sweat, you should expect it to quickly acquire an unpleasant and unsanitary appearance. How do you clean your sauna suit?

If your sauna suit is made of certain materials, you might be able to wash it in the washing machine. However, if the suit does not come with instructions for how to care for it, hand washing is the preferable alternative. The suit needs to be washed on a frequent basis, but the exact frequency is going to be determined by how often you wear it and how sweaty you get. Make sure that it is rinsed completely so that there is no trace of any residue left behind.


## The proper way to clean a sauna suit

It is not difficult to clean your sauna suit by hand.

Be mindful of the kind of fabric you are washing while using your washing machine to clean a sauna suit because this is the method that is both the quickest and the easiest.


When washing items in a machine, check that the machine is set to the gentlest cycle possible. It is essential that the temperature of the water be lowered to a low setting since certain substances will melt at higher degrees.

Use a gentle laundry detergent, and if you can find a washing cycle with a gentle spin setting or one without spinning at all, that would be ideal. Because the washing machine can be harsh on some materials, it is essential to use a detergent and cycle that are as gentle as is humanly possible when laundering these items.

Before you throw your sauna suit in the washing machine, make sure you read the care instructions carefully and keep in mind that different types of materials used in sauna suits have varying levels of maintenance requirements.

## Different sauna suit materials

Sauna suits can be found in a wide range of sizes, forms, and materials to choose from.

The type of cleaning that is best suited for your sauna suit will be determined by the material it is constructed of. It's possible that your sauna outfit is constructed of:

* PVC
* Nylon
* Neoprene

### PVC

PVC (or polyvinyl chloride), a thin and flexible plastic, is used to make some sauna suits.

Sauna suits made of PVC should be hand washed. PVC sauna suits should not be dried or ironed. To achieve the best drying results, pat dry with a towel to avoid water spots before hanging it in a cool, dry place.

Stretching the clothing may cause damage to the thin plastic, so washing machines may cause more harm than good. Use only small amounts of liquid detergent and rinse thoroughly to prevent residue from forming and causing staining or wear on the clothing.

Warm or hot temperatures may also cause the plastic to melt, causing damage to the material.

### Nylon

Nylon, a thin synthetic material, is used to make some sauna suits.

Nylon can be washed in a washing machine, but proceed with caution. Too much machine washing of this material can cause pilling, which will eventually damage the suit.

When using a washing machine, use a delicate or gentle cycle and cold water. Bleach should not be used.

When drying nylon in a dryer, use very low temperatures or no heat at all (tumble dry setting). Keep an eye on it because nylon dries quickly. If you use heat, it shouldn't take much longer than 15 minutes.

### Neoprene

Neoprene, a synthetic rubber, is used in the construction of some sauna suits.

Keep neoprene away from the washing machine. The washing machine may break down the material over time, causing wear and tear. Hand washing is best for neoprene; use warm soapy water and thoroughly rinse it.

Neoprene should not be dried in the dryer. Avoid direct sunlight and hot temperatures by hanging the item to dry.
