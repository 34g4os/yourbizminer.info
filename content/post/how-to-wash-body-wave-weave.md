## How do you take care of body wave bundles?
First, use a clean towel to dye your hair, but do not use a hair dryer. Remember not to blow dry, because when the hair is wet, the epidermis of the hair is open, and it is easy to break the hair when you blow dry. Then let it dry naturally in the air until there are no water drops, but it is not completely dry.May 28, 2021
