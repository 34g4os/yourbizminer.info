## Should I wash my cosplay wig before styling it?
But please, calm down: wet wigs always look like a disaster. There's nothing to worry about! Washing a wig is actually quite simple. It is important to wash wigs between styling to get all of the hairspray and styling product out before you start your next styling.Aug 7, 2011

## What can I wash my wig with?
Yes, you can wash synthetic wigs but we recommend only using wig shampoo and conditioner specially formulated to clean fibers gently and thoroughly. Regular hair care products may contain chemicals that can damage synthetic wigs so we do not recommend using regular shampoo or conditioner to wash your wigs.Dec 13, 2021

## Can you wash human hair wigs in the washing machine?
“It doesn't tangle and you can wash wigs. You manually fill the machine about half way and then add the shampoo, turn the knob to let it swish around then add the bundles. The wash cycle is about fifteen minutes, drain the water, add more water then you activate the rinse cycle.”Mar 14, 2016
