## Does boiling a shirt damage it?
It like a plastic, They say you can use boiling hot water and heat dry on the highest setting but this can damage your shirt. I would not recommend this.

## Does boiling fabric shrink it?
The heat from boiling water constricts the fabric fibers, making the shirt smaller. Fill a large pot with water. Make sure there's enough water in the pot to completely submerge the shirts you want to shrink. Put the pot on the stove and bring the water to a boil.Dec 11, 2018
