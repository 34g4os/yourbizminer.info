Why is Co-Star so inaccurate? It has not demonstrated accuracy in monitored studies and it cannot fully determine the behavior of every individual, meaning that reliance on an app like Co-Star can affect the users&amp;rsquo; perspectives and behaviors, even if the information is not correct.</description>
