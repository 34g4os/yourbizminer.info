<p>“All the minerals and heavy metals in hard water can cause your hair to become dry, brittle, brassy, and dull,” Lee explains. “Your scalp can also get flaky and itchy, too.” Not only can hard water affect the way your hair feels, but also how it looks, particularly when it comes to salon color.</p>

<p>What does hard water do to your hair? Hard water is water that is high in dissolved minerals, particularly those such as calcium and magnesium. When pure rainwater filters through rocks, soil, and even sand, it naturally picks up mineral salts like calcium and magnesium.Sep 1, 2020</p>

<p>“Harder water tends to strip natural oils from the scalp and hair as well as pull color and moisture from the hair,” says Lopez. On the other hand, soft water will cause your texture to feel softer and silkier, but can also leave hair feeling heavy.Jun 15, 2020</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because hard water contains a buildup of minerals, such as calcium and magnesium. This produces a film on the hair, making it difficult for moisture to penetrate. As a result, the hair is left dry and prone to breakage. Leave these issues unresolved and it could even lead to hair loss.Sep 29, 2020</p>
