<p>Handwash in cold water with a splash of detergent aka a capful of laundry soap (or even regular hand soap).

<p>It&rsquo;s recommended that you shouldn&rsquo;t bind your chest for more than 8 hours per day. If you are in a scenario where you will need to keep the binder on for longer, such as at work or school, take a break and take off the binder when you go to the bathroom or another private location.Apr 9, 2021</p>
