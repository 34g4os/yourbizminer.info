<p>Just take a small bowl and fill it with shampoo and warm water. Move the brush around in the solution until you see soap suds forming. Do this for about 60 seconds. Then rinse your brush with warm water to remove the soap and allow to air dry.</p>

<p>I like to do this with my synthetic bristle brushes first. I wash the back and then using the hair brush, I run through the bristles. The idea is to loosen the dirt and the warm soapy water really helps with this. After I have done my synthetic brushes, I repeat the process with the real hair brushes.</p>

<p>Use dish soap and hot water for dirty brushes if you don&rsquo;t have wax softener. Put a few drops of dish soap on the bristles and run them under hot water. While rinsing the brush, buff it back and forth on a chamois to help the polish soften and release from the bristles.</p>

<p>Thoroughly spray all surface areas with an effective disinfectant. Lysol is a good choice if the walls are particularly manure-stained; it&rsquo;s more effective in the face of organic material than other products. Bleach is a good alternative if the surfaces are very clean.Mar 18, 2020</p>

<p>Another way to sanitize brushes is to add moderate amount of Listerine® mouthwash to the wash water— it smells nice and kills bacteria. Soak the brushes for several minutes, agitating them to loosen dirt. Rinse and repeat the process until the water is no longer discolored and you don&rsquo;t see any soap suds.</p>
