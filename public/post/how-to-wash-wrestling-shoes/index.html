<p>Generally, it is safe to wash canvas shoes and athletic shoes made of nylon, cotton or polyester in your washing machine. You want to make sure you drop your shoes in a mesh bag before you drop them into the wash cycle. It is also important to use a good laundry detergent to ensure thorough cleaning of your shoes.Aug 26, 2020</p>

<p>Put Shoes in Washing Machine Shoes can damage your wash drum. That is why we recommend putting them into a wash bag or pillowcase to protect them from getting caught on the drum. To reduce the loud noise, wrap your shoes in the same color towel and put in wash bag or pillowcase.</p>
