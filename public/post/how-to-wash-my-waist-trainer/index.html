<p>Because your waist trainer has a high latex/rubber content, it will smell of rubber when you get it out of the packet. I suggest that you leave it out in the open air for a while. If it is still quite strong smelling, give it a little sponge down with some nice smelling water!</p>

<p>You might temporarily lose a small amount of weight wearing a waist trainer, but it will likely be due to loss of fluids through perspiration rather than loss of fat. You may also eat less while wearing the trainer simply because your stomach is compressed. This is not a healthy or sustainable path to weight loss.Jul 1, 2019</p>

<p>If you go to the gym and lost 20lbs of fat,that fat doesn&rsquo;t move somewhere else. Rather, it metabolises into carbon dioxide and leaves your body through breathing.

<p>Tightly-cinched waist trainers make it hard to use your abdominal muscles, which can make them weaker. This could make your waist appear slimmer over time since the muscles become smaller. &ldquo;If your waist appears to be smaller after a few weeks, it&rsquo;s likely due to water loss and muscle atrophy,&rdquo; Vargo says.May 12, 2022</p>

<p>Lots of waist-training advocates suggest wearing a trainer for 8 or more hours each day. This is risky. It&rsquo;s best not to wear one on a long-term basis, and you should definitely avoid sleeping in a waist trainer.Aug 24, 2020</p>

<p>After about a month of wearing the corset 9+ hours a day I started to see a change in my shape. After 6 months I noticed a decrease in my belly fat and an increase in my hourglass shape out of the corset. At 12 months I have a nicely pronounced hourglass waist out of the corset.</p>

<p>We don&rsquo;t recommend that you wear your waist trainer more than the maximum of twelve hours each day. This gives your skin more opportunity to breathe and your torso the opportunity to relax. If you&rsquo;re using a workout band for waist training, we don&rsquo;t recommend wearing it for more than about three or four hours.Oct 3, 2018</p>
