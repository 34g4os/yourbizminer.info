<p>How to Wash Puffer Jackets. Use a front-loading or newer top-loading machine to wash your puffer jacket, or hand wash if necessary. Typically, these types of washing machines don&rsquo;t have the center agitator that can catch and tear materials, like the delicate top layer of a puffer coat.</p>
