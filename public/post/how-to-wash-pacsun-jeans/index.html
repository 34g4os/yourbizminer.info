<p>Before you start wearing the jeans, give them a soak (a hand-wash without detergent). The warmer the water the higher the shrinkage. After the first soak, wash the jeans whenever needed with either hand-washing or machine-washing. If you want high contrasts, postpone machine-washing as long as possible.</p>

<p>When you get a new pair of jeans, early loving care is important when it comes to long-lasting denim. The best way you can do this is to wash your jeans by hand and wash them alone.

<p>Many jeans manufacturers recommend that you wash jeans separately for the first few times. That means before the first time you wear them and for the next few washes afterward. This is because some of the dye will bleed out of the jeans and stain any other clothes that are in the wash with them.</p>

<p>Start by putting your jeans in the washing machine and selecting the hottest water setting (should be 60° or more).

<p>Washing and drying the jeans results in the hydrogen bonds becoming pulled and stressed. And when this occurs, the jeans are likely to shrink. Of course, shrinking is more common in some jeans than others, so it&rsquo;s important to choose the right type (we&rsquo;ll get to that later).Jan 31, 2017</p>

<p>Make a splash: For new or lightly soiled jeans, you can use the soak cycle on your washing machine. Let the tub fill with water then mix in a gentle detergent made for dark fabrics. Turn your jeans inside out and lay them in the water – you can fold them to fit if need be, but don&rsquo;t bunch them up.</p>

<p>Prior to wearing your new jeans for the first time, you need to soak them. Soaking will remove starch and chemicals, making the fabric softer and help it last longer. (Make sure you know if your raw denim is sanforized or unsanforized. If sanforized or &ldquo;one-wash&rdquo; you won&rsquo;t need to soak them.)Aug 27, 2015</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is one rule to washing your jeans: Do it as seldom as possible to preserve their shape, quality, and color.

<p>The general rule of thumb is to wear your jeans for as long as you can stand before washing them, since the fades will be more pronounced and personalized the longer you go without bleeding the dye in the wash.
