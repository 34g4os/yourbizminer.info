<p>ANSWER: It is not a good idea to wash whites with colored clothes if you want your white clothes to stay white. Cold water washing will not make clothes bleed color like hot water will. Color transfer can still happen when using only cold water so it is best to keep colors and whites separated.Apr 6, 2016</p>

<p>A general rule of thumb is to stick with cleaning black clothes with darker cloths that do not leak and whites with whites, although they can be washed with lighter clothes like gray you&rsquo;re sure do not bleed.

<p>In short, Screen printed clothes do not react well to bleaching. In fact, Bleach can distort the color and cause premature fading. The agents in bleach are capable of altering the color of fabric threads and the dyes employed in the screen-printed t-shirts.Jul 9, 2018</p>

<p>Answer. Normally I recommend the bleachability test to determine if a colored item can be safely washed with Clorox® Regular Bleach2: Add 2 teaspoons bleach to ¼ cup water and apply a drop of the solution to a hidden part of the item; wait 1 minute and blot dry; no color change means the item can be safely bleached.</p>
