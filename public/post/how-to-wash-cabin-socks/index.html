<p>Since TRUsox simultaneously grip your foot and footwear, they must be worn with direct contact to both the foot and shoe. Use of a traditional sock over or under the TRUsox will create a point of slippage and reduce effectiveness. Machine wash in cold water with like colors. No Bleach.</p>

<p>A front-loading washing machine is preferred, but, regardless, wash your socks in the gentle cycle with cold water and light detergent. I use The Laundress Darks Detergent, which is a specially-formulated enzyme-based detergent that prevents any fading.</p>

<p>Wool socks help keep you warm when temperatures get colder, but they should be washed after wearing them a few times. Like other wool clothing, socks can shrink and deteriorate unless they&rsquo;re washed properly. Whether you use a washing machine or wash your socks by hand, you can have a fresh pair to wear!</p>

<p>Machine-wash on gentle cycle in warm or cool water (avoid hot water as heat may shrink wool). Use mild soap, no bleach or fabric softener (bleach destroys the Merino wool fibers, and fabric softener coats those fibers—reducing their ability to naturally manage moisture and regulate body temperature).</p>

<p>If you are sure the socks are made from merino wool or superwash yarn, you can put them in the dryer on low. However, do not use a dryer for any other types of wool socks. If you are unsure about your socks, err on the side of caution by air drying. Make certain the socks are completely dry before putting them away.</p>

<p>So how often should you wash your wool socks? That depends on how long you wear them per use, the activity, climate, and your own comfort level with re-wearing clothing. I&rsquo;ve found washing them after 2-3 full days of wear to be a good balance. That said, I have some friends who&rsquo;ve worn them upwards of a month.Jul 1, 2021</p>

<p>Hand or machine wash (on the gentle setting) with cold water. Wool is a delicate fiber and warm water will cause the fibers to shrink. Use water under 70 degrees Fahrenheit to insure the colors won&rsquo;t bleed. If washing in the machine, wash only by themselves to avoid any possible color bleeding.</p>

<p>Also, if you overload the washer, socks can get pushed into the area between the inner tub and outer tub. Once that happens, you will never see them again. When it comes to front loaders, some socks get caught in the washer&rsquo;s filter. If your washing machine has a clean-out area, open it and look for socks.Apr 12, 2022</p>

<p>Put the washing machine on a gentle cycle and use cold water to wash socks. You can also soak the socks for 30 minutes or 1 hour in cold water before putting them in the machine for washing. Use a good detergent that protects the fabric and also the colors. Harsh detergent may damage your socks.</p>
