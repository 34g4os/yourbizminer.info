<p>Check the wash tags of your Bape College item. Most of the time, the fake Bape items&rsquo; wash tags are too thin or too thick. Inspect the neck tag of your Bape item. Usually, the fake Bape College items have their letters on the neck tag looking too thick and the (R) registered trademark symbol has the letter “R” too big.</p>

<p>Bape uses YKK zippers, which are one of the (if not the) most popular types of zippers across the world. However, YKK zippers are also replicated. As a consequence, they will jam often or simply not work as smoothly as they&rsquo;re supposed to.</p>

<p>Looking for advice on shirts and hoodies/crewnecks . I wash it inside out in cold water (wool program even for cotton), gentle spin in machine (so it does not stay wet for days) and then hang dry.Feb 2, 2017</p>
<h2 id="how-do-you-wash-a-hoodie-1">How do you wash a hoodie?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-do-you-wash-a-hoodie-1">#</a></h2>
<p>Turn the hoodie inside out and zip any zippers so they don&rsquo;t snag on other clothing items. Use cold water and standard detergent and run the hoodie through a standard wash cycle so it doesn&rsquo;t shrink. When your hoodie is done, lay it out on a clean towel to help it air-dry to avoid shrinkage.</p>

<p>To make the chest area wider, hold both side seams and pull gently in both directions. Keep stretching, using gentle but firm pressure, until the hoodie reaches the size you want. Do not put the damp hoodie in the dryer! Instead, let it air dry.</p>

<p>The best way to authenticate a Bape Shark Hoodie would be to inspect all the labels. The neck label uses particular fonts for the logo text, make sure those are respected. Make sure that the washing label has the right model code indicated, as this is one of the common flaws found in the replicas.</p>
