<p>In the process, the heat opens the pores of the fabric and applies pressure to cool down the ink and return to the solid form. It results in a permanent, full color image which does not fade, peel, or washes away. Sublimation printing is growing rapidly and is a preferred method for small batch orders.Mar 4, 2021</p>

<p>But first, let&rsquo;s answer the burning question: How long do Sublimation Transfers Last? We have pressed transfers up to 14 months after being printed and the results were perfect. It&rsquo;s worth noting that we use high quality sublimation paper and we store our prints in a dry, cool, dark environment.</p>

<p>The principle of sublimation paper is at high temperature the ink film will melt further, and then melting in the cloth. Therefore, the above condition implies that sublimation printing with a poor transfer paper washes out the ink after washing. Thus, gradually leading to fade.Apr 11, 2021</p>
