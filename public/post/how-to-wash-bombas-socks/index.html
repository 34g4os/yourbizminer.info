<p>What we loved: Bombas specializes in t-shirts, socks, and underwear, and indeed, these slippers are more sock than slipper.

<p>Because of the materials we use, your socks will shrink just once—and just a tiny bit—the first time you wash them. After that: never again! Similarly, your Bombas T-shirt should shrink only minimally after the first wash and won&rsquo;t pill, ensuring that it looks fresh even after long-term wear.</p>

<p>Bombas Sock Sizing Review Like most high-quality cotton or wool socks, Bombas will shrink a little the first time they&rsquo;re washed. This shouldn&rsquo;t affect you much—but if you happen to be in-between sizes, you will likely want to opt for a size up to accommodate a little shrinkage. What is this?</p>

<p>If your Woolmark-approved garment&rsquo;s care claim says that you can machine wash your piece of wool clothing, then it means it can safely be machine washed in a washing machine multiple times, without shrinkage taking place. Wool garments should be washed on the wool setting (usually gentle action at 40°C).</p>

<p>Wool socks help keep you warm when temperatures get colder, but they should be washed after wearing them a few times. Like other wool clothing, socks can shrink and deteriorate unless they&rsquo;re washed properly. Whether you use a washing machine or wash your socks by hand, you can have a fresh pair to wear!</p>
<h2 id="can-you-machine-dry-wool-socks">Can you machine dry wool socks?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#can-you-machine-dry-wool-socks">#</a></h2>
<p>Dry your wool clothes by laying them flat (hanging wet wool may distort the shape). If you prefer the dryer, tumble-dry on low setting. And, as always, check the care label. A few of our products still shouldn&rsquo;t be dried in the dryer.</p>
