<p>When washing your hoodies, cardigans or pullovers, ensure you do so in cold water. You can wash these garments in your washing machine using a mild detergent. Delicate garments made from silk, wool and cotton require extra care and using a mild detergent can work wonders.Sep 15, 2020</p>

<p>Use Cold Water Cold water is less likely to shrink or fade and ruin clothes, especially anything made of cotton. Cold water can also reduce wrinkles, which saves both time and the energy costs associated with ironing. Your best bet with hoodies, cardigans or pullovers is washing with cold water on a gentle cycle.Jan 5, 2022</p>

<p>Select a gentle wash setting with cold water (hot water is not ideal for synthetic fabrics) and let the cycle run. Skip the fabric conditioner—the chemicals in these products will coat the outside of your clothes with a waxy substance that will prevent sweat from evaporating from the surface.May 24, 2019</p>

<p>Before you place your sweatshirt in the washing machine, turn it inside out. This helps protect the outside of the garment from damage that could occur during the wash cycle. When washing zip-up hoodies, be sure to zip them. This prevents the zipper from getting snagged in the wash.Oct 14, 2019</p>

<p>Shrink Cotton Hoodies Hold your clothing under a faucet of warm water to saturate it. Use your hands to wring excess water out of the material and place it into the clothes dryer. Set the clothes dryer on a low heat setting to shrink the clothing minimally and high heat for optimal shrinkage.</p>

<p>Try submerging your sweatshirt in hot and/or boiling water, and use a hot heat setting to launder your garment. If your shirt is not shrunk enough after using the washer and dryer, run an iron over top of a wet sweatshirt. With either method, you may be able to shrink your sweatshirt to your liking!</p>
