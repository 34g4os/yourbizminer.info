<p>It might seem impractical but hunting clothes should be washed after every hunt. Your body odor will permeate your clothes after just a few hours in the field.Jun 7, 2021</p>

<p>Yep, vinegar and baking soda. I&rsquo;ve been washing my hunting clothes that way for more than 30 years. I hang them on a line to dry and then store in an airtight container with pine boughs, dirt, etc.Nov 25, 2013</p>

<p>As soon as possible after the hunt, thoroughly wash the game bags with unscented heavy-duty detergent (Tide and Persil contain enough stain-removing enzymes to remove stains) and a light solution of chlorine bleach using the hottest water possible.Feb 23, 2021</p>

<p>The acetic acid in distilled white vinegar is so mild that it will not harm washable fabrics; yet is strong enough to dissolve residues (alkalies) left by ingredients in soaps and detergents. Adding just one-half cup of vinegar to the final rinse will result in brighter, clearer colors.Apr 1, 2022</p>

<p>The white residue from baking soda can fade the vibrant hues of your favourite cashmere wool and silk fabrics. Baking soda has a very high pH level which can fade the keratin protein in organic fibres. Some dyes will also react negatively with baking soda leaving your fabrics looking dull and discoloured.Dec 14, 2021</p>

<p>Do not make the mistake of thinking that natural and organic additives are weak. A lot of people are using baking soda, for example, to remove unpleasant odor from clothing and to keep white fabrics bright. When it comes to washing dark clothing, you can use vinegar, salt and even baking soda.Apr 13, 2015</p>

<p>As an Alternative to Bleach For whites and colors, baking soda does double duty. When added to the washer, it makes whites whiter and brightens colored items. It&rsquo;s a good substitute for people who prefer not to use bleach. Or, for loads of white clothing, give bleach a boost by adding a half-cup of baking soda.Dec 17, 2020</p>
