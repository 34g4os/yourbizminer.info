If you actually delete and unplug everything it will throw codes.May 25, 2015\nDoes EGR delete increase horsepower? It may reduce your overall horsepower. The EGR delete kits are often thought about when using an older diesel engine. There are design issues with the previous generation of products that allowed a bypass to make more space for clean air in the combustion chamber.Jan 12, 2019\nDoes EGR delete require tune?

When the engine’s performance increases, so does the fuel economy.Nov 12, 2019\nWhy does my Duramax sound like a typewriter? This noise is caused by the relationship of the engine cylinder block, crankshaft journals, bearing inserts and the oil film. This relationship may allow a vibration that resonates through the cylinder block and is heard as a metallic ticking noise.Oct 22, 2011\nDoes EGR delete increase sound? It’s normal. The EGR delete will increase the noise noticibly.Sep 7, 2018\nWhat does deleting the EGR on a Duramax do? An EGR delete consists of using a delete kit to remove the system.

<p>Installing an EGR delete kit reduces costs on repairs and fuel costs, as well as decreases soot deposits that an EGR valve produces. Disabling it prevents harmful contaminants from being reintroduced back into the engine, resulting in problems. When the engine&rsquo;s performance increases, so does the fuel economy.Nov 12, 2019</p>

<p>This noise is caused by the relationship of the engine cylinder block, crankshaft journals, bearing inserts and the oil film. This relationship may allow a vibration that resonates through the cylinder block and is heard as a metallic ticking noise.Oct 22, 2011</p>

<p>Use the EGR delete can cause some engines to begin knocking once the modification work is complete. Some of this issue is due to the change in the temperature profile of the engine. You can also create a knock because the quality of oil that runs through the engine degrades faster than normal.Jan 12, 2019</p>

<p>Will deleting my EGR cooler set my Check Engine Light? In some cases, yes. Installing an EGR delete on 2006 and up 6.0L trucks WILL result in the check engine light.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because the ECU controls the entire EGR. After its physical removal or blocking, the ECU may trigger error codes and a check engine light. Installing the EGR delete kit with tuner or new program helps to prevent these issues. EGR delete remap or reprogramming is usually necessary in newer vehicles.</p>

<p>Your title asks if you can delete the EGR without a tune, but you state you have a tune. If you have a GDE Hot Tune then you already have the EGR programmed out, which means you can delete it with a stage 2 delete kit (removing the EGR and all components and rerouting the coolant).Nov 5, 2019</p>

<p>An EGR delete helps you restore your diesel engine&rsquo;s power levels which, in turn, also restores your overall fuel efficiency. Since an EGR delete kit sends the exhaust gas away from your car&rsquo;s engine, it starts to run cleaner, too.</p>

<p>Yes, just the EGR delete is important Deleting the DPF will increase mileage and improve overall performance, but it doesn&rsquo;t keep the engine cleaner. Personally, I think blocking off the EGR is more important than deleting the DPF, if you care about the engine.Oct 29, 2009</p>
