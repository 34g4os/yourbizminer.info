<p>You can either hand wash the lining in a bowl of warm water and use some baby shampoo (baby shampoo because it doesn&rsquo;t contain conditioner). Or, you can put it in the washing machine on the delicates (30 degree C) setting. But always read the manufacturers instructions before you do, just to be on the safe side.</p>

From there, fill the tub with warm water and your choice of either mild laundry detergent, baby shampoo, or dish soap. Let it soak for a few minutes, then start scrubbing.Nov 30, 2018</p>
