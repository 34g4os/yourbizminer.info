<p>If you are in a non-weight bearing cast/splint, we recommend having something to sit on in the shower like a lawn chair, etc. Check the stability of the chair while the shower floor is wet to avoid any accidents. Baths and cast/splints usually don&rsquo;t mix.</p>

<p>You can either use a free standing shower stool, a shower chair with a backrest, which is better if you have trouble sitting up, or a wall mounted seat . Again you may need advice from an expert. You can either go for a wetroom or install glass panels that fold back to allow access.</p>

<p>Using paper as a cover will not do the job; instead, it will cause more mess than a wet cast, which is why using plastic bags is an excellent way to keep a cast, plastic or fiberglass, dry in the shower.

<p>You should use some form of water protection for your cast every single time you shower or bathe. If your cast happens to get wet, you&rsquo;ll want to pay a visit to your doctor to check it and see if it needs to be replaced.Apr 29, 2018</p>

<p>Wrap the duct tape around the bag, make sure the tape is tight, but not too tight. If you are in a non-weight bearing cast/splint, we recommend having something to sit on in the shower like a lawn chair, etc. Check the stability of the chair while the shower floor is wet to avoid any accidents.</p>

<p>A wet cast can lead to skin irritation or infection. Plaster casts and fiberglass casts with conventional padding aren&rsquo;t waterproof. Keep your child&rsquo;s cast dry during baths or showers by covering it with two layers of plastic, sealed with a rubber band or duct tape.</p>

<p>If you have a waterproof cast, then you can bathe and shower as normal. Make sure to run clean water through your cast after bathing or showering to make sure any residual soap is out. Soap that is not rinsed out can become a source of itchiness. Make sure the cast is completely dry before getting it wet again.</p>

<p>It is OK to remove the brace for showering but be careful. Rest and elevate your leg (above the level of your heart if possible) for the first 24 hours by placing a pillow under your calf and/or ankle. Do NOT place a pillow under your knee as it will keep you from straightening your knee.</p>

<p>Getting Up and Down From a Toilet: Back up to the toilet. Reach back for the armrests/raised toilet seat/seat. Slide your operated leg slightly forward and lower yourself slowly onto the toilet. To stand, use a grab bar or place your hand at the middle of the center bar of the walker.Aug 11, 2016</p>

<p>When you shower, keep your bandage and incision dry by taping a sheet of plastic to cover them. It might be best to get a shower stool to sit on. If you have a brace, only take it off if your doctor says it&rsquo;s okay. If your doctor does not want you to shower or remove your brace, you can take a sponge bath.</p>

<p>Showering is another common problem for people in a cast or on crutches. If there&rsquo;s space, place a small chair in your shower for you to sit on so you don&rsquo;t risk slipping and falling. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to place a non-slip mat on the floor (in and out of the shower) so you don&rsquo;t slip.</p>
