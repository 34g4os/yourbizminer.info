<p>DocuSign eSignatures are not always completed, so we may need to void (cancel) an envelope and send a new one. By voiding an envelope, the transaction cancels all outstanding signing activities. You can void any uncompleted envelopes that you have sent.Nov 4, 2021</p>

<p>You can only Correct or Void envelopes in an In-process state: Created, Sent and Delivered. Once an envelope is in a terminal state: Completed (signed), Declined and Voided it can no longer be Corrected or Voided. You will need to contact the sender to negotiate with the sender to delete the document.</p>
