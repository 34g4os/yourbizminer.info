<p>I have had a chilipad for 5 years and I clean it every three months. I first pour out all of the water in reservoir and then I fill it back up with a mixture of 75% distilled water and 25% hydrogen peroxide. I then turn the temperature up to as high as it will go and let it run that way for 3-4 hours.</p>
