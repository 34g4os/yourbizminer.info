<p>Nothing bad can happen to wool when you wash it if you use the right settings and products.

The fabric can also become damaged, pulled, or snagged by using a too intense setting for the wool fabric to handle.</p>

<p>If you own a wool blanket that you&rsquo;re reluctant to use because the fabric feels hard and itchy, try softening it. To increase the softness, add a dime-sized portion of leave-in hair conditioner. Hold the blanket under the water for a few seconds, as this will encourage the fibers to absorb water.</p>
