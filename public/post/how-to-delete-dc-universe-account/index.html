<p>Sorry, but pretty sure you can&rsquo;t. PS4 and PC have cross-play with one another now, but characters (and their gear and everything else associated) are still tied to the account platform you created it on (PC or PS4). You can&rsquo;t play a PS4 character on a PC DCUO login, and vice versa.Jun 11, 2020</p>
