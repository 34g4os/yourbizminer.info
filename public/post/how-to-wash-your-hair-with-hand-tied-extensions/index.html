<p>When conditioning your extensions, it is recommended that you practice an every-other-wash routine. That way, they are getting the moisture they need, but won&rsquo;t have a lot of buildup from over-conditioning. It is also important to deep condition your extensions. Doing this once or twice a week would suffice.Jan 15, 2021</p>

<p>Taking care of your new Hand-Tied Hair Extensions at home can be a little bit of an adjustment, but don&rsquo;t let that scare you! Most women admit it&rsquo;s like being high-maintenance just one or two days a week to be LOW maintenance every other day!</p>

<p>Can I Still Wear My Hair Up? Yes absolutely!! The hair is sewn in right at the scalp; and you can see that I can still easily wear my hair up in a bun or ponytail without my extensions showing. I actually find that tie in extensions are easier than tape-in extensions when it comes to wearing your hair up.Aug 21, 2019</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re washing your wefts in a sink, make sure it&rsquo;s clean. You should only ever wash your hair and extensions with lukewarm water. Once your extensions are wet, use 2 – 3 pumps of a sulfate-free shampoo to wash your hair. Be careful that you don&rsquo;t wash the hair too vigorously, especially near the bonds or clip.Sep 16, 2020</p>
