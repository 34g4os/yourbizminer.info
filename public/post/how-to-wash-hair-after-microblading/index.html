<p>When Can I Wash My Hair After Microblading? Washing your hair without getting your eyebrows wet can be very tricky. Therefore, you need to avoid washing your hair for at least 3 days after the treatment, and after that be extremely careful not to get your brows wet.</p>

<p>Do not let any water, lotion, soap, or makeup touch your eyebrow area during the first 7 days after your procedure. Please wash your face carefully around the eyebrow without getting water on the treated area. During the shower, keep your face away from the shower head or take a bath.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s safe to gently wash the area 2 weeks post-procedure to remove any buildup. If you still have a few scabs that are clearly still attached, do not intentionally try to remove them. Allow them to fall off naturally, and continue to wash the area gently everyday until they do.</p>
