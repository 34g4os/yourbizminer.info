<p>Manila Rope is an all-natural fiber rope, made from the Abaca plant. It&rsquo;s sometimes referred to as hemp rope, and it&rsquo;s a great general utility rope for someone looking to use rope for outdoor activities, decor, marine use, landscaping, exercise climbing rope, fishing nets, farm work, tug-of-war, or towing lines.Aug 20, 2018</p>

<p>Simply just take a bucket full of water, add some fabric softener to form a solution and finally dip your ropes inside. You can soak the ropes overnight or rather even for an hour depending on which you prefer. Harsh detergent powders and soaps should not be used.Sep 11, 2021</p>

<p>The best option is to place the rope under a shelter (where it will be protected against the elements) or store it away after use. If this isn&rsquo;t possible, you will need to account for the shrinkage by adding 10-15% to your required length. It&rsquo;s also a good idea to put the rope in situ and leave it for several days.</p>

<p>Brushes can be used as long as they are made of soft bristles that won&rsquo;t destroy the rope. Tip: For certain rope, if you want to make them soft, you can use a small amount of fabric softener in the water while washing. It&rsquo;s important that all of the fabric softener is cleaned out of the rope before drying and using.Mar 23, 2020</p>

<p>Both Camellia and Jojoba oils are a great choice for treating jute ropes: they are light(ish) oils, odourless and fantastic for the skin. They also have decent shelf lives (up to 2 years) and penetrate easily into the fibres of the ropes.Apr 1, 2020</p>

<p>We also recommend that you store your ropes in a cool, dry, open location away from sunlight when possible.

Keep your rope as dry as possible.</p>

<p>Use a non-bleach detergent soap like the Sterling Rope Wash™ or another non-bleach detergent soap. Do Not Use Bleach! Hot water alone will also generally wash a rope pretty well.

<p>Clean them regularly Vacuuming is a quick and easy way to get rid of any surface dust. To tackle stubborn dirt and stains, we advise using a mild soap and cold water to wash the rope by hand. Once you&rsquo;ve covered the full length, rinse it well and leave it to dry naturally (away from direct sunlight).</p>
