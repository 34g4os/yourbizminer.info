<p>You can spot-treat most stains on suede with a suede brush and eraser. But more serious stains require a good suede shampoo or a mix of soap and water to really penetrate the soiled areas.

<p>From my research I found technically you can wash your leather goods in the machine as long as you are okay with the texture and look, and possibly the color changing during the wash. For some leather goods, like suede, avoid trying to machine wash since the structure of the suede fabric weakens when wet.</p>
