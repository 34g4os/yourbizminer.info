<p>I don&rsquo;t recommend them for everyday use. If you wear them too long, for example, or sleep with your magnetic lashes on, it can lead to infection of the eyelid or lash loss,” said Gafni. &ldquo;I think they&rsquo;re fine for special occasions but should not be your go-to for your everyday makeup routine.&ldquo;May 14, 2021</p>

<p>Magnetic lashes are reusable. After you use them, you can give them a gentle clean, and they will be good to go again. As they are reusable up to around 50 times, they have a much longer lifespan than regular false lashes. They are also a much lower price point than eyelash extensions.Jul 17, 2020</p>

<p>Normally, those made from synthetic material can be worn up to eight times, while those made from animal hair - including mink lashes - provide up to 30 wears. But again, this depends on the brand and how meticulous you are in taking care of them after use.</p>

<p>To ensure your lashes and magnets are perfectly clean, you should use 90% alcohol. Simply coat a cotton swab with alcohol and run it along the strip of the lashes and the magnets. This will ensure your AddictaLash magnetic lashes are completely free of any makeup or eyeliner residue and ready for the next use.</p>

<p>Well, for one thing, they&rsquo;re eco-friendly. As long as you take care of them, magnetic eyelashes will last indefinitely. Unlike fake lashes that use glue, magnetic eyelashes don&rsquo;t need to be gently cleaned after each use if you want to wear them again.Dec 12, 2021</p>

<p>No, magnetic lashes won&rsquo;t ruin your natural lashes and are considered relatively safe, especially if you&rsquo;re using magnetic eyeliner lashes.Feb 28, 2022</p>

<p>Even a metallic foreign body on the surface can cause problems and it can definitely lead to serious issues if it penetrates inside your eye. The magnetic eyeliner I used is comprised of iron oxides. Iron oxides are mineral deposits and can cause staining of the skin.</p>

<p>Elise Brisco, OD, CCH, integrative optometrist and clinical homeopath, says yes, overall, magnetic lashes are safe to use around the eyes. She explains that magnetic eyelashes are even better than using traditional false eyelashes because you don&rsquo;t need to apply glue close to the eye area.</p>
