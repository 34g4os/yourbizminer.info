<p>Untuckit is billed as premium menswear, and that means most of its catalog carries a premium price tag with some shirts running north of $100.

<p>A regular cycle is best for sturdy and dirty clothes, while the permanent press setting is fine for the average load. Use the delicate cycle for lacy and loosely woven fabrics. Use hot water for white loads, warm water for the average load, and cold water for bright colors.Jan 30, 2020</p>
