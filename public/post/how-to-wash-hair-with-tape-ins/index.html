<p>Washing your hair every day is a bad idea when you have tape in hair extensions. Stick to washing them no more than three times a week. Like it or not, washing your hair every day is a big no when you&rsquo;re wearing tape hair – you shouldn&rsquo;t wash your tape ins any more than three times a week. Twice a week is even better.Aug 13, 2021</p>
