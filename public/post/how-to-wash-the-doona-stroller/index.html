Simple Parenting’s Doona infant car seat easily converts to a stroller, making running errands with your baby a snap.

The stroller is a “mobility solution,” but it’s not meant for long walks in the park.Jun 22, 2015\nWhy is the Doona unsafe?

Like I said, the Doona isn’t intended to be an all terrain pushchair. It’s intended for school runs and whizzing about town and popping into the shops. Because of this it doesn’t have any suspension or bouncy wheels to cushion the blows. If you’re on a rough surface it will be bumpy for your little one.Jun 25, 2015\nIs the Doona worth it for travel?

<p>Simple Parenting&rsquo;s Doona infant car seat easily converts to a stroller, making running errands with your baby a snap. The Doona is a car seat first, said Roni Golombek, product manager at Simple Parenting. The stroller is a “mobility solution,” but it&rsquo;s not meant for long walks in the park.Jun 22, 2015</p>
<h2 id="why-is-the-doona-unsafe">Why is the Doona unsafe?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-is-the-doona-unsafe">#</a></h2>
<p>Before anyone asks, Doona is actually banned in Canada as well because the angle of the car seat is not adjustable and hence considered unsafe according to Canadian standards. Don&rsquo;t even try to sneak it through the border – it&rsquo;s subject to a ton of fines and voided insurance.</p>

<p>For most babies, this will be somewhere between 12-15 months old, but for those parents with little peanuts, some have been able to use the Doona up until 24 months.Apr 29, 2022</p>

<p>Because they&rsquo;re typically used to go over rougher terrain, they tend to have heavy-duty air-filled wheels, a comfortable suspension, hand brakes, parking brakes and high handlebars. Just be on the lookout for three-wheelers that are really “hybrid” models that you can&rsquo;t really jog with!May 15, 2022</p>

<p>Like I said, the Doona isn&rsquo;t intended to be an all terrain pushchair. It&rsquo;s intended for school runs and whizzing about town and popping into the shops. Because of this it doesn&rsquo;t have any suspension or bouncy wheels to cushion the blows. If you&rsquo;re on a rough surface it will be bumpy for your little one.Jun 25, 2015</p>

<p>The Doona costs $549, making it less expensive than most stroller/car seat travel systems. But because you&rsquo;ll have to purchase another stroller once your child outgrows the Doona, you may determine the Doona isn&rsquo;t worth the money. In general, you can expect to spend between $250 and $400 for an infant car seat.</p>
