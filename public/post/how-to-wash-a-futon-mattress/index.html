<p>There are three dry methods. They include vacuuming your futon, sunning your futon and sprinkling your futon with baking soda. Your futon mattress needs sunlight to help remove excess moisture from the fibers, while vacuuming removes dirt, dust, or skin cells from your mattress.Jul 4, 2019</p>

<p>Airing Out Hang your futon mattress for a few hours outdoors during a time of day when the air is relatively dry. This will kill any possible fungus or mold and prolong the life of your mattress. The fresh air also keeps it from smelling stale and allows its natural crimp and loft to return.Dec 11, 2019</p>
