<p>Early model year 6.4L Powerstroke are susceptible to chafing on the high pressure fuel pump harness. Over time, vibrations can cause the wires to be exposed. Once exposed, you run the risk of shorting your high pressure fuel pump. That&rsquo;s an expensive repair you don&rsquo;t want to risk!Jan 21, 2020</p>
