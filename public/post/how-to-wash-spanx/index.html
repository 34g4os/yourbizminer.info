<p>Spandex/Nylon Like polyester, nylon is a heat-resistant, shrink-resistant synthetic fabric. It can stand higher washer and dryer cycles than pure spandex can. However, in a blend with spandex, the garment will be more prone to shrinkage.</p>
<h2 id="is-nylon-safe-in-the-dryer">Is nylon safe in the dryer?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#is-nylon-safe-in-the-dryer">#</a></h2>
<p>As nylon dries quickly, it&rsquo;s recommended that nylon is put through a low temperature cycle, as well as grabbed the nylon out of the machine as soon as possible, as it can be damaged if left in the dryer too long. Nylon also builds up static cling, so be sure to dry with a dryer sheet to avoid getting zapped.May 19, 2018</p>

<p>Spandex resists shrinkage well. To make a spandex-only garment (such garments aren&rsquo;t common) shrink, you have to expose them to lots of dryer heat and hot-water treatments. But when blended with other fibers that are prone to shrinking such as cotton, linen, and rayon,spandex clothes can shrink significantly.Feb 7, 2022</p>

Clothing that contains a small amount of spandex material, such as jeans, could be okay to put in the dryer.Feb 3, 2017</p>

<p>We recommend warm water with some washing up liquid and a non-abrasive cloth. Wring the cloth out so that it&rsquo;s not dripping wet and wipe over. Follow up by drying off with a soft cloth such as a microfiber cloth. This stops general wear and tear and everyday marks from building up and making the surface look grubby.</p>
