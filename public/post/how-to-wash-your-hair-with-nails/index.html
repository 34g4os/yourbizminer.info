<p>And the worst thing to do is scratch your scalp with your fingernails. You risk scraping and cutting your scalp every time. This can cause your scalp to become inflamed and even get infected. It will be as painful and irritating as a cut anywhere else on the body.Sep 21, 2019</p>

<p>Scalp exfoliation is usually performed on wet, just-shampooed hair. After you comb through and separate sections of your hair, you can apply the scrub with your fingertips. You can also use a brush or glove designed for exfoliation. If you&rsquo;re using a physical exfoliant, rubbing in a gentle, circular motion can help.</p>
