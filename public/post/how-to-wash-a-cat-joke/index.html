<p>As a general rule, cats are extremely clean animals and spend most of their time grooming themselves. If your cat has short hair and stays indoors, regular brushing will be enough. It isn&rsquo;t bad to bathe cats if it is necessary, though.Dec 10, 2017</p>

<p>Cats do a good job of cleaning most debris from their coat, but their self-grooming won&rsquo;t get everything out, nor will it make them smell any nicer. The National Cat Groomers Institute of America recommends a bath once every 4-6 weeks.Apr 18, 2021</p>

<p>The average indoor cat may never need a bath, but if you do decide to take the plunge, we do not recommend bathing your kitty more than a couple of times a year. Only you know your cat&rsquo;s personality and levels of aggression, which can be a key deciding factor when it comes to bathing a cat.Jun 1, 2020</p>

<p>Veterinarians agree that it is actually unnecessary to bathe your cat as regular as you would a dog. While bathing them occasionally will help keep them healthy, unless instructed by your vet you should never bathe your cat weekly or a couple of times per week. You might do more harm than good with this mindset.Dec 11, 2018</p>
