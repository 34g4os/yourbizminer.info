<p>Fleece liners are economical: they can help you save hundreds of pounds over the years. They are much easier to clean and create no mess in the house (in contrast to wood shavings). They are also comfortable for your guinea pigs as they adore fleece!</p>

<p>Under the best of bedding circumstances, you&rsquo;ll need to refresh midweek and full clean once a week. Sometimes, you need to refresh or clean every other day. Sometimes every 3 days.</p>

<p>It depends on the number of guinea pigs, their habits and even their diet (since some veg will make them urinate more). As a rule of thumb, we observe that liners need to be changed every 2 to 4 days.</p>

<p>Make Sure Your Fleece Is Wicking Properly If you want clean cages for your little friends, you need properly wicked fleece. If your guinea pigs constantly wade through their own urine and the stench of pee is in the air, that often means that fleece isn&rsquo;t wicking properly.</p>

<p>Fleece is NOT a &ldquo;Set it and Forget it&rdquo; bedding solution! Not so with fleece. With shavings or Carefresh, the poos tend to mix up and move a bit deeper into the bedding and away from the guinea pig on the top layer.</p>

<p>Pros of Using Fleece Bedding for Guinea Pigs I love that fleece is reusable. Since I have three cages, it would add up very quickly to constantly be rebuying paper bedding or shavings. It&rsquo;s totally possible to make fleece liners yourself if you have a sewing machine.Jan 27, 2021</p>
