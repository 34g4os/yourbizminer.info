Personally, I would strongly discourage any student from applying to more than 15 colleges.Jul 27, 2018</p>
<h2 id="how-many-colleges-can-you-apply-to-through-the-common-app">How many colleges can you apply to through the Common App?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-many-colleges-can-you-apply-to-through-the-common-app">#</a></h2>
<p>20 colleges</p>
<h2 id="can-you-apply-to-multiple-colleges-on-common-app-2">Can you apply to multiple colleges on common app?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#can-you-apply-to-multiple-colleges-on-common-app-2">#</a></h2>
<p>Through the platform, first-time and transfer applicants alike can apply to multiple colleges at once. So students only have to fill out details that most schools require, including name, address and extracurricular activities, one time.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-if-you-apply-to-too-many-colleges">What happens if you apply to too many colleges?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-happens-if-you-apply-to-too-many-colleges">#</a></h2>
<p>While most students spend time trying to decide where to apply to college, they should also be considering how many applications to send out. Applying to too many schools can lead to a heavier workload, added stress, and tougher decisions.</p>
