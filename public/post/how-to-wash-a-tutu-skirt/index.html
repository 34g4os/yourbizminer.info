<p>To get the best out of your tutu, fluff up the skirt layer by layer and give it a good shake to ensure maximum volume! Between wears, we recommend spot-cleaning any marks on the tulle, or a very gentle cold handwash if absolutely necessary. Our cottons and knits can be handwashed, and silk garments can be dry cleaned.</p>

<p>For example you definitely don&rsquo;t want to pre-wash a fabric that says &ldquo;dry clean only&rdquo;! I would say the same about tulle and delicate fabrics that should be handled with care. Costume fabrics that are doused in glitter and are only going to be worn once obviously should not be pre-washed.Jul 21, 2016</p>

<p>Washing tulle by hand in cool water with mild soap works well. Strong detergents and bleach should not come in contact with this synthetic. Although machine washing can work, tulle can tear by catching in zippers and other clothing hardware while agitating.</p>

<p>Select the delicate cycle on the washing machine, and make sure the water temperature is cold and the spin is on low. Add the appropriate amount of Delicate Wash according to the machine and load size. Lay the item flat in its natural shape on a drying rack or hang to dry. Do not put it in the dryer!</p>
