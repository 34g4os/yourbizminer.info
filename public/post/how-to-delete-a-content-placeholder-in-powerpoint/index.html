<p>Select the problem slide, then choose View&gt;Slide Master. The layout for the slide will appear. Cut all items that should be editable, close the master view and paste them on the slide. If that doesn&rsquo;t fix the issue, the text boxes may be locked in the XML, which is a little more involved to repair.Jul 15, 2019</p>
