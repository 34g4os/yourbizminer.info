<p>Why do hoodies shrink? Cotton is the most popular material for hoodies because it is so soft and comfortable, but there is one major drawback: It shrinks when exposed to heat. If you machine wash your hoodie with warm water and throw it in the dryer after, it is going to be much smaller when you take it out.Feb 28, 2021</p>

<p>Enlarging a cotton sweatshirt or hoodie typically requires a combination of moisture, heat and stretching. If a hot dryer has shrunk your hoodie down a size or two, the process can help return it to its original shape. It also works well if you&rsquo;re outgrowing the garment, or if you just want a baggier fit.</p>
