<p>Fill a sink or tub with cold water, add a very small amount of clothes detergent and swish it so suds start to form. Soak your item for 30 minutes, then rinse it in clean, cold water. Roll the clothing in a towel to remove excess moisture, and let it air dry on a plastic hanger or rack.Aug 13, 2020</p>

<p>Wash them by hand or on a gentle cycle using a gentle or sports detergent. Do not use fabric softeners which can build-up on the fibers and make the leotards less breathable. Use warm or cold water—never hot. Do not dry them in your dryer.May 20, 2021</p>

<p>Hand-washing is the only way to go. Leotards are made using high-performance fabric and are often embellished with accents like crystals or sequins; the washing machine, even on the delicate cycle, can aggravate the fabric and the decorations. Fill your sink with cold water.Dec 21, 2017</p>

<p>It is possible for the heat of the dryer to shrink the garments slightly, but they stretch back to their original sizes when worn again. If the shrinkage bothers you a lot, simply wash the items in the washing machine and lay them flat to dry. &ndash;Leotards should be cared for in a similar manner to swimwear.Sep 8, 2015</p>
