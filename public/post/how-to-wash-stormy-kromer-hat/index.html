<p>Wool is naturally water-repellent, and although it won&rsquo;t be able to keep you completely dry in a heavy rain storm, a wool hat can protect you against light precipitation and snow. Wool is a popular choice for winter weather because it has the ability to insulate even when it takes on moisture.</p>

<p>Retrieve the wool cap from the towel and carefully place it on something clean and round &ndash; a melon, a soccer ball, even a balloon will do &ndash; and about the size you&rsquo;d like the cap to be. The wool will stretch relatively easily at this point because the fibers are wet.</p>

<p>Check the material on your hat&rsquo;s tag before washing it. Look for the manufacturer&rsquo;s tag inside the ballcap. Materials like cotton or synthetics are safe to put inside your dishwasher, but cardboard or wool could get damaged. If the tag says &ldquo;hand wash only,&rdquo; don&rsquo;t put the hat in the dishwasher.</p>
