<p>With a cover, your wool comforter may last from 15 to 25 years with regular cleaning. Without a protective, washable cover, your comforter will not last as long and may need to be replaced sooner. Other materials do not last as long and use unnecessary chemicals, making your sleep environment unhealthy.</p>
