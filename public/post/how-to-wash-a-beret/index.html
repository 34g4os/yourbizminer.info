<p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be too tight but it shouldn&rsquo;t be too loose at the same time. You also need to be careful that you don&rsquo;t damage the outer fuzzy layer of the beret. This inside lining is the main part of every single beret and its purpose is to protect the hat from possible damage before the owner starts wearing it.Mar 19, 2020</p>

<p>SOAK YOUR BERET Soak your beret thoroughly. If it&rsquo;s a soldier pattern (wide crown - hangs down over your ear when you put it on and smear it down your head), you&rsquo;ll want to soak in alternating hot, then cold, then hot, to shrink the crown. If it&rsquo;s officer pattern (narrow crown), just soak it in warm water.Jul 11, 2015</p>
