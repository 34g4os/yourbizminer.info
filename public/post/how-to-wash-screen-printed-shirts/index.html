<p>Washing Screen Printed T-Shirts. The absolute best way to safely wash your custom printed tees is by hand. Turn them inside-out, mix cold water and a mild detergent in a small tub, let soak for 10 minutes or more, then gently agitate for a few minutes, rinse, and let them air dry.Feb 28, 2022</p>

<p>Primarily the cause of the ink cracking is from the ink not curing. Ink that is not cured will crack when you pull at the shirt (after it has cooled down) or will crack when washed. Reasons it might not be cured: Dryer temperature too low.Feb 27, 2017</p>

<p>We recommend you wash your t-shirt at a cooler temperature (no more than 30″C) to preserve the artwork and minimise shrinkage. Cold wash is ideal, of course. It will get your clothes clean and it&rsquo;s certainly gentler on the fabric. There&rsquo;s no good reason to use harsh cleaning products on your clothes.</p>

<p>A typical coated screen generally will be dry to the touch after one hour at 70°F (21°C) and relative humidity of 50%. When the drying environment is 100°F with 20% humidity, however, a coated screen can be completely dry in as little as 15-20 min.Apr 20, 2019</p>

<p>Using fans will blow dirt and lint directly on the screens. The best method for drying is one that filters the air, raises the temperature and removes moisture saturated air. A complete seal on a cabinet will prevent contamination, but will also concentrate air in a small area causing moisture saturation.</p>
