<p>You can wash cloth diapers in a front-load machine; you just have to tweak your routine. Front-load and HE machines don&rsquo;t have an agitator like typical top-loaders do. Instead, they rely on the clothes rubbing together in the wash to get clean (2).Mar 16, 2022</p>

<p>To get rid of smell, soak overnight in water and add some vinegar to bring the pH of the water down. This will dilute the stuff stuck in the diapers and it will wash out better. Time + dilution.
