<p>Airbnb have created a dedicated private messaging platform on their site for hosts and guests. All communications prior to bookings need to take place via the platform. Only registered Airbnb users can use the platform.</p>

<p>There are no “private messages” on their servers. Everything you message another user can and will be read without your consent (their “fine print” about privacy doesn&rsquo;t actually say that outright of course but I guess they interpret that as your consent). There was an issue with my very first booking (of course).Jul 23, 2018</p>
<h2 id="can-guests-see-airbnb-messages-1">Can guests see Airbnb messages?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#can-guests-see-airbnb-messages-1">#</a></h2>
<p>yes you are right. You can not see if the message was seen or not. It would not be possible as it a guest could not only read the message here in the airbnb-system but also as email or textmessage (if its short enough). So you can just ask, like &ldquo;Did you get my message?&ldquo;May 31, 2016</p>
