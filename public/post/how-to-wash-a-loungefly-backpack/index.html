<p>How can you clean and protect your Loungefly bags? First, before you get to the point of needing to clean them, I recommend using a guard like Scotchguard or Starbrite Ultimate Vinyl Guard to protect them from water and sun damage. Use just one of those in one or two coats to protect your bag from future damage.</p>
