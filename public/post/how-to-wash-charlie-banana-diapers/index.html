Is there special way to clean cloth diapers with poop if my baby is breastfed?

If you don’t have a cleaning cycle and you are using a top loader you can let the washer drum fill with HOT water, add the Affresh, vinegar or lemon juice, let it agitate for a few minutes and then stop the cycle and let it soak for at least an hour. After the hour is up, allow the washer to finish the cycle.\nDo you need a separate washer for cloth diapers? You can wash cloth diapers in a front-load machine; you just have to tweak your routine. Front-load and HE machines don’t have an agitator like typical top-loaders do. Instead, they rely on the clothes rubbing together in the wash to get clean (2).Mar 16, 2022\nHow do you wash diapers in a washing machine? If you have soft water and think the problem is detergent buildup, run the diapers through the wash on a very hot water cycle — no additive and no detergent.
